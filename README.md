# Flinders.Foundation.Testing #

This repository contains a [UiPath][uipath] library project. It was used by the
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at [Flinders University][flinders] to
automate testing of our projects.

## Important note - Archived Repository ##
This repository has been archived and marked as read only. This library was
developed by the RPA team at [Flinders University][flinders] before unit testing
was part of the core UiPath Studio product. 

[UiPath Studio][uipathstudio] now includes the ability to implement [test cases][uipathtesting].
This custom library is no longer required. The RPA team at Flinders has migrated all of 
our tests away from this library. 

The repository is now archived and remains for historical purposes.  

## Documentation ##

Documentation on each activity is available in the [wiki][wiki].

## Acknowledgements ##

The RPA team acknowledges the assistance of [RPA Solutions][rpa-solutions] in
the development of an earlier pre-release version of this library.
